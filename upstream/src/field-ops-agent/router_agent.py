"""Router Agent — Concept #3: Voice routing pattern (front desk).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DEMO POINT — "Voice latency: how to fill the dead space"

Talk track (the gap Demo-script.md step 10 explicitly calls out):
    "This will likely take a few seconds to pull up, so we need to capture
     the dead space ideally"

Without this pattern: user asks → silence → 8-15 s while tools run → answer.
With this pattern: user asks → 1 s "Looking that up." → optional 'still on it'
                   filler → final answer. Same total time; way better feel.

How it works (this file):
  - The router is a SINGLE LLM call with ``tool_choice="required"``.
    The model is forced to pick exactly one of five meta-tools — there is no
    free-text path. That eliminates the "I'll look into it…" hallucinations.
  - Five meta-tools (defined in ``ROUTER_TOOLS``):
        respond_directly      pure chat / acknowledgments / delivering results
        start_task            delegate real work to the worker agent
        check_task_status     report progress of a running task
        cancel_task           stop a running task
        get_task_result       relay a finished result
  - ``execute_router_tool`` is the dispatcher used by main.py's request handler.
  - The actual heavy lifting happens in ``worker_agent.py`` (the MAF agent).

Why this is a "Microsoft 365 Copilot routing" pattern, not a hack:
  - Router = front desk. Always responsive, never blocks.
  - Worker = back office. Does the work, takes as long as it takes.
  - Tasks survive client disconnect. If the voice channel drops mid-wait,
    the worker keeps running and the answer is delivered on the next turn.

Tools:
  respond_directly — for chat, greetings, delivering completed results
  start_task       — delegate field-ops work to worker (includes ack_message)
  check_task_status / cancel_task / get_task_result — meta-operations

# Force the model to always call a tool (no free-text path)
ROUTER_TOOL_CHOICE = "required"

ROUTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the front-desk assistant for field operations technicians at Microsoft data centers.

You MUST call exactly one function per turn. You cannot respond with plain text.

FUNCTION SELECTION:
- respond_directly: greetings, chat, clarifications, capability questions, delivering completed results, acknowledging user, answering from conversation history, ANY question unrelated to field-ops
- start_task: user provides a COMPLETE, ACTIONABLE field-ops request (they've given enough info to act on)
- check_task_status: user asks about progress of a running task
- cancel_task: user wants to stop a task
- get_task_result: retrieve a finished task's result that hasn't been shown yet

WHEN TO USE start_task vs respond_directly:
- "Analyze document 12345" → start_task (actionable: document ID is provided)
- "Can you analyze a document?" → respond_directly (capability question, no document specified)
- "Search site specs for Quincy North" → start_task (actionable: site name provided)
- "Can you look stuff up?" → respond_directly (no specific request)
- "How old are you?" / "What's the weather?" → respond_directly (unrelated to field-ops)
- "Great" / "Thanks" → respond_directly (acknowledgment)

RULES:
1. For greetings/chat/thanks/acknowledgments ("Great", "OK", "Thank you", "Got it", "Perfect", etc.) → ALWAYS call respond_directly. NEVER re-trigger a task for these.
2. For questions UNRELATED to field operations (personal questions, general knowledge, small talk) → ALWAYS call respond_directly, regardless of any running tasks.
3. Only call start_task when the user provides a SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE request with enough parameters to execute (e.g., a document ID, a site name, a procedure type). If key information is missing, call respond_directly to ask for it.
4. Do NOT call start_task if a running task already covers the same request (check "Running tasks" context).
5. Do NOT call start_task if the user is referring to a result that was ALREADY delivered. If the result is in conversation history or in "Recently delivered" context, call respond_directly and re-state it.
6. If "Recently completed" results exist in context, call respond_directly and include those results naturally in your message.
7. If the user asks to recall/replay/repeat a previous result, look at conversation history or "Recently delivered" context and call respond_directly with that information.
8. Match the user's language. Keep messages concise (voice-enabled, hands-free).
9. When the user's message has BOTH chat and a NEW actionable field-ops request, call start_task (the ack_message handles the conversational part).

IMPORTANT: A message like "Great", "Thanks", "OK" after a delivered result is just the user acknowledging — respond with something brief and friendly. Do NOT re-run the task.
IMPORTANT: If there is a running task and the user says something UNRELATED, just respond with respond_directly. Do NOT create a new task.

STYLE: concise, helpful, technical when needed. The technician is working hands-free."""
